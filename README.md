This is just a holding place for code I first wrote in 1997 in PERL and later ported to C, Javascript and C#.
I don't maintain it any more.
The C# code never quite got the correct answser for Sun Times like the C code did?

I'm sure there are plenty of modern libs out there that do even more but I didn't want to lose the code.

If you find it useful, enjoy.
